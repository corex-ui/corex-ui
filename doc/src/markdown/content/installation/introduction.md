# Installation

Corex UI is a **framework-agnostic design system** providing **accessible, unstyled UI components** that can be easily integrated into any modern web application.

Components are **unstyled by default**, giving you full control over your design system.
Corex UI offers **optional styling** using **design tokens** to **Tailwind v4** variables, components and utility classes.

Whether you want a fully custom look or a fast, pre-styled setup, Corex lets you **compose, extend, and theme components** effortlessly while maintaining accessibility and best practices.
