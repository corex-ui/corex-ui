# Figma Guide

In this guide, we’ll learn how to work with **Figma** and **Corex UI Design Tokens** using the **Tokens Studio plugin**.

**Tokens Studio for Figma** is the bridge between your Figma designs and the design tokens generated by Corex UI.  
It allows two-way synchronization between your token files and your design styles — keeping **design and code perfectly aligned**.

You can learn more about the plugin in the [Official Tokens Studio documentation](https://docs.tokens.studio/).

## Tokens File

You can find the Figma-compatible tokens file inside the Corex UI GitHub repository in the `@corex-ui/design` package:

[https://github.com/corex-ui/corex-ui/blob/main/packages/design/tokens/tokens.json](https://github.com/corex-ui/corex-ui/blob/main/packages/design/tokens/tokens.json)

This file follows the **Tokens Studio schema**, with organized groups for colors, typography, spacing, radii, and themes.

If you are using `Tokens Studio Pro` you can also find the multi files tokens
[https://github.com/corex-ui/corex-ui/blob/main/packages/design/tokens/multi](https://github.com/corex-ui/corex-ui/blob/main/packages/design/tokens/multi)

## Installation

1. Install **Tokens Studio for Figma** from the [Figma Community](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/843461159747178978/tokens-studio-for-figma).
2. Open or create a new Figma design file.
3. Launch the plugin via  
   **Right-click → Plugins → Tokens Studio**.

---

## Connect Your Token File

There are two main ways to connect your Corex UI tokens:

### Option 1 — Local JSON File (Manual)

1. Open **Tokens Studio** inside Figma.
2. Go to the **Settings** tab.
3. Choose **Storage Type → File**.
4. Click **Load from File** and select your downloaded `tokens-figma.json`.
5. Your tokens will now appear in the left panel, grouped by category (color, typography, spacing, etc.).

---

### Option 2 — GitHub Sync (Recommended)

If your tokens are stored in a GitHub repository (e.g., your design system or Corex UI fork):

1. In **Tokens Studio**, go to **Settings → Storage → GitHub**.
2. Connect your GitHub account.
3. Enter the repository URL, for example: `https://github.com/user/my-corex-ui`
4. Set the file path:  
   `packages/design/tokens/tokens.json`
5. Click **Connect**.  
   Tokens Studio will now stay in sync with your remote token file automatically.

## Apply Tokens in Figma

Once your tokens are loaded, you can:

- Apply **color tokens** to fills, strokes, or text.
- Apply **typography tokens** to text layers.
- Use **spacing and radius tokens** in auto-layouts.
- Use **themes** to switch between light and dark or brand variations.

You can also **link tokens to Figma styles**:

1. Go to the **Sync tab** in Tokens Studio.
2. Click **Link Figma Styles**.
3. Select which groups to link (e.g., Colors, Typography).
4. Tokens Studio will automatically create or update your styles.

---

## Export Back to Code

After editing your tokens in Tokens Studio:

1. Open **Settings → Storage**.
2. Click **Push Changes** (if using GitHub sync).
3. Your JSON file will be updated in your repository — ready to use in your Corex UI or Style Dictionary build.

## Tips

> **Two-Way Sync**  
> Tokens Studio can both read and write tokens — perfect for design + dev collaboration.

> **Best Practice**  
> Always store your tokens in GitHub rather than local files — it allows design updates to flow automatically to your build pipeline.

Now your workflow between **Corex UI**, **Figma**, and **Tokens Studio** is fully connected and production-ready
